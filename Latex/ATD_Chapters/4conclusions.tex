In this document, we have presented the results of the tests conducted on the application to ensure its quality, correctness, and compliance with the requirements identified in the RASD and ITD documents. While the application successfully implements several features, critical issues were identified during testing. 
The most critical issues include the lack of authentication enforcement, which allows unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities, the absence of a complaint system, and application crashes when a student attempts to open an interview sent without a questionnaire. These issues significantly impact the application's usability, security, and reliability, and should be addressed promptly to ensure the application's overall quality.\\
We appreciate the opportunity to test the application and provide feedback on its functionality and performance. The idea of creating an application instead of a website is innovative and has the potential to improve the user experience with new features that would be impossible to implement on a more traditional platform, such as the use of the camera to take a picture of the students or the CV. We hope that the issues identified in this document will be addressed promptly to ensure the application's quality and reliability.\\
