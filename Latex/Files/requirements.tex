\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
This chapter provides a detailed description of the system's external interfaces such as the User, Hardware, Software, and Communication interfaces. 
\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
The user interface will be designed to improve intuitiveness and simplicity. The platform root page is the Home Page from which every non-registered user can find information about S\&C such as the latest news. The Home page is linked to other pages, such as the Dashboard, Contacts, and About page, using an app bar. 
In the Contacts page, the user can find useful links to get in touch with S\&C. 
\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{UI Home Page: as an example, UI cards containing some user scenarios described in the \ref{subsec: user scenarios}  are shown}
    \label{fig:homepage}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Latex/Images/New Ui/Contacts.png}
    \caption{UI Contacts Page}
    \label{fig:contactpage}
\end{figure}
\noindent Thanks to the app bar link buttons, users can also reach the Sign-Up and Sign-in pages. The Sign-Up page allows for different types of sign-up according to the new user type. This allows the user to provide the platform with the correct information.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.33\textwidth]{Latex/Images/New Ui/SignUp University.png}
    \caption{UI Sign-Up Page}
    \label{fig:signuppage}
\end{figure}
To be able to log into the platform, the user shall provide his email and password. 
\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Latex/Images/New Ui/SignInPage.png}
    \caption{UI Sign-In Page}
    \label{fig:signinpage}
\end{figure}
\noindent The Dashboard page will be the central hub for logged-in users. From the left-hand panel of the dashboard, all the pages associated with the core functionalities of the platform are reachable. Therefore, this page is provided after a successful log-in. The side panel contains different elements according to the user needs.

    \caption{UI University Dashboard Page}
    \label{fig:universityDashboard}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
The platform is a web application that can be accessed from any device with a web browser and an internet connection like a PC, a tablet, or a smartphone. No specific hardware requirements are needed to interact with the Student\&Company platform.
\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
\label{subsec:SWInteface}
An Email Provider, through its interface, is used by the Platform to send a confirmation email to Users upon registration. \\
A notification manager is used to send notification to Users when relevant events occur. Using notifications instead of email allows the platform to provide a more immediate and interactive experience to the Users without generating spam that can be seen as annoying by the Users.\\
At this stage of development, no other external software interfaces are required.
\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
The platform uses standard internet communication protocols to interact with Users and the backend server. At this stage of development other specific communication interfaces are not defined yet.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the system's use cases, detailing the various interactions between Users and the system.
Use Case Diagrams, detailed Use Case Descriptions, Sequence Diagrams and Requirement Mapping are provided for each use case.

    \label{fig:UniveristyUseCaseDiagram}
\end{figure}
This diagram concentrates on the functionalities offered to Universities. It shows how Participant can create a Complaint, and how the University can handle it. \\
More importantly, it shows that a complaint can be handled “as is” by the University, or it can be extended either by the other Participants how respond to such complaint or by the University itself that can interrupt an Ongoing Internship.

\subsubsection{Sequence Diagrams}
The functions used in the sequence diagrams follow these conventional meanings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{press(Button)}: Represents the action of a user pressing Button.
    \item \textbf{submit(Content)}: Indicates a user uploading Content to the platform.
    \item \textbf{showPage(Page)}: Displays the content of a specific Page.
    \item \textbf{showError(Error)}: Displays an error message indicating an issue that occurred.
    \item \textbf{showMessage(Message)}: Displays a generic message to the user.
    \item \textbf{notify(What, Who)}: Represents a notification forwarded to the NotificationManager regarding What and intended for Who.
    \item \textbf{check()}: Verifies the validity of the information provided by the user.
    \item \textbf{update(Data)}: Refers to internal processes that update database records with Data.
\end{itemize}
For readability, in all diagrams except the first four, the user login process is omitted. It is assumed that the user is already logged in and navigating the dashboard. Accordingly, the S\&C processes are depicted as already in progress.\\

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
 Given the system's non-critical nature, stringent performance criteria are unnecessary. However, to ensure an optimal User experience, the system should:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The system shall notify Users within 2 seconds after an event has occurred
  \item The system shall respond to User requests within 2 seconds under normal load conditions
  \item The system shall support at least 1000 concurrent Users
  \item Database queries shall be completed within 1.5 seconds
  \item The system shall handle up to 10,000 internship listings simultaneously
  \item The system shall support up to 100,000 registered Users
  \item The system shall support up to 1000 registered Companies
  \item The system shall support up to 100 registered Universities
  \item The Recommendation Process shall be completed within 300 seconds under normal load conditions
  \item The Suggestions computed by the platform shall be provided to the User within 180 seconds after the CV or the Internship Offer has been submitted
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Design Constraints}
This section explain the different constraints that the platform must respect such as the standard compliance for the data protection and hardware limitations.
\subsubsection{Standards Compliance}
Student\&Company will handle and process highly sensitive data, including but not limited to personal information, CVs of Student and proprietary information of Company and University.\\
Because of that the Platform must not only be able to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and any other Data/Privacy Law present in the countries where the Platform will be used (e.g California Consumer Privacy Act "CCPA" or similar law), but also have to be flexible enough to adopt custom policy set by Companies and Universities to protect their data and the data of their own users.
\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The platform is a web application that can be accessed from any device with a web browser and an internet connection. No special hardware is required a part from a device with a network card
\subsection{Software System Attributes}
This section provides an overview of the system's key attributes such as reliability and availability, security, maintainability, and portability explain in a technical and non-technical way.
\subsubsection{Reliability \& Availability}
The platform is designed to be highly reliable and available to Users, with a target uptime of at lest 99.862\%. This means that the system should be unreachable for Users for no more than 12 hours in a year. To achieve this, the platform will be hosted on redundant servers with automatic failover capabilities and a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly between the different machines. \\
Furthermore, to ensure the availability of the platform, scheduled maintenance will be schedule during low traffic days such as during winter or summer break. . This approach is intended to guarantee that the system remains fully operational at the start of each semester when the traffic expected to be much higher due to the increase in the number of Students and Companies looking for Internships.\\
\subsubsection{Security}
Due to the highly sensitive nature of the data processed by the platform, security is a top priority for S\&C. We will implement a multi-layered security approach to protect the data of our Users such as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The use of HTTPS protocol to encrypt the data exchanged between the User and the Platform
  \item Strong password requirements and email verification for all users
  \item Failed login attempts shall be limited to 5 before temporary account lockout
  \item Password encryption using industry-standard hashing algorithms such as MD5 or SHA-256
  \item Role-based access control to ensure that Users can only access the data they are authorized to see
  \item Verification of Companies and Universities profile will be conducted using their VAT numbers, once the official governance API becomes available.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The system should be designed to be easily maintainable and scalable to accommodate future growth. This includes the use of modular code, clear documentation, and a well-defined architecture that allows for easy updates and modifications both on the front and the back end. \\
The platform should also be designed to be easily scalable to accommodate an increase in the number of Users and Internship Offers and in a way where the need of adding new features or fixing bugs should not require a complete overhaul of the system.\\
\subsubsection{Portability}
As a web application, the platform is inherently portable by design, allowing access from any device equipped with a web browser and an internet connection. There are no additional portable constraints on the server-side infrastructure of the platform.
