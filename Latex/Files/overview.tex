        MacroHard opens the platform and, on the page displaying the lists of matched students, clicks on the “Create Interview” button. This option allows the company to create structured interviews that will be submitted to candidates. The business sets up an “InterviewTemplate”, a collection of questions that includes both quizzes, which the S\&C platform can automatically evaluate, and open-ended questions that require manual review. They may also include one or more video calls in the template, the outcomes of which can be recorded on the platform as a grade. The InterviewTemplate tracks each interview’s outcomes, allowing both the candidate and the company to monitor the interview progress.\\
        MacroHard create multiple InterviewTemplates for the same internship, allowing them to submit different templates to different students based on factors such as the student’s CV, method of application (matched or spontaneous), or other criteria. Each template is created only once and can be reused for different students or internship opportunities.\\

        The platform notify the company that Marco has applied for the internship and will inform the student if and when the company will start the application process by sending him a structured interview. There is no need for Marco to accept the interview, as a spontaneous application is considered as an implicit acceptance of the match by the student.

\subsubsection{Class Diagrams}

\subsubsection{State Charts}
The following section provides a series of state diagrams that illustrate the evolution of the main phases of the Student\&Company platform. For this purpose, we propose three diagrams representing the Recommendation Process evolution with the corresponding Spontaneous Application variant and the Interview Process.

\textbf{Raccomandation Process}\\
%\includegraphics[width=1 \textwidth]{Diagrams/RaccomandationStateChart.png}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Recommendation Process is the core of the Student\&Company platform. It is the process that matches Students with Internships based on the Student's CV and the Internship's requirements. It is initiated by the platform when it detects a potential Match. The process then evolves to a 'WaitingForConfirmation' state, where the system waits for the Student and the Company to accept the Match. If one of the two parties rejects the Match, the process is terminated. If both parties accept the Match, an Interview is initiated, and the process is terminated.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Spontaneous Application Process}\\
%\includegraphics[width=1 \textwidth]{Diagrams/SpontaneousApplicationStateChart.png}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unlike the Recommendation Process, the Spontaneous Application process is initiated by the Student. When a Student submits a Spontaneous Application for an Internship, the process evolves to a 'WaitingForConfirmation' state, where the system waits for the Company to accept the Application. If the Company rejects the Application, the process is terminated. If the Company accepts the Application, an Interview Process is initiated, and the process is terminated.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Interview Process}\\
%\includegraphics[width=1 \textwidth]{Diagrams/InterviewStateChart.png}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Interview Process is initiated when a Match is accepted by both the Student and the Company, or when a Spontaneous Application is accepted by the Company. The process starts in the 'Interview Creation' state, where the Company is asked to submit a Template Interview or create a new one. Here, the Company is required to specify a deadline for the Interview. The Interview process evolves into the 'InterviewSubmitted' state once the Company sends the Template to the Student, who answers the questions and submits the Interview. If the Student fails to submit the answers within the deadline, he will be considered rejected, and the process is terminated. Otherwise, if the Template includes open-ended questions that require manual evaluation, the process evolves to a 'ToManualReview' state before entering the 'Consolidation' state. If the Template is fully automatic, on the other hand, the process evolves directly to the 'Consolidation' state. In the 'Consolidation' state, if the Student successfully passes the Interview, he is required to specify if he wants to accept the Internship or reject it before the expiration of the deadline, after which he will be considered rejected. Either way, the process is terminated right after.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions, dependencies and constraints}

\subsubsection{Domain Assumption}
This section outlines the basic assumptions about the environment and behaviour of entities that interact with the system. These assumptions simplify the design and implementation by defining expectations about Students, Companies, Universities, and the platform, ensuring the system operates effectively within its intended context.
\begin{enumerate}[label={\color{titleColor}[D\arabic*]}]
    \item Students and Companies provide the Platform with correct and truthful information
    \item Companies remove published Internship if they are no longer available
    \item Students, Companies, and Universities receive every notification
    \item Students, Companies, and Universities have a working internet connection
    \item Universities interrupt an ongoing Internship only if no solution to complaints/problems are found
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
